# SquashIt – Multi-Phase Bug Tracking Application

<img alt="SquashIt Logo" src="IssueTracker.Api/images/logo.png" width=200px height=120px>

A multi-phase software engineering project demonstrating database design, backend development with ASP.NET Core Web API, and a future full-stack expansion using React.

---

## 📌 Overview

SquashIt is a structured, three-phase portfolio project that evolves from a console application into a production-ready backend and (in Phase 3) a full-stack web application. Each phase builds on the previous one to demonstrate clear architectural growth and real-world engineering practices.

This repository contains:
- **Phase 1:** Console application with EF Core, data modeling, and CRUD operations  
- **Phase 2:** Backend Web API using ASP.NET Core and Clean Architecture  
- **Phase 3:** (Upcoming) React frontend that consumes the API  

Each phase includes its own dedicated README.

## 🏗️ Project Phases

### Phase 1 – Console App & Data Layer
- C#, Entity Framework Core, SQLite  
- Code-first migrations and relational modeling  
- CRUD operations via EF Core and LINQ  
- Console-based interface  
- Foundation for domain and data logic  

See `/Phase1/README.md` for full details.

---

### Phase 2 – Backend Web API (Complete)
- ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 8)  
- Clean Architecture: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API  
- RESTful CRUD endpoints with DTOs and dependency injection  
- EF Core persistence using SQLite  
- Swagger/OpenAPI for documentation and testing  
- Backend prepared for frontend integration  

See `/Phase2/README.md` for full details.

---

### Phase 3 – Full-Stack Frontend (Upcoming)
- React + Vite + TypeScript (planned)  
- UI for managing issues through the API  
- Frontend routing, forms, validation  
- Deployment of frontend + backend  
- Final case study combining all three phases  

Phase 3 will be added soon.
