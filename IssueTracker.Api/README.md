## 🐞 SquashIt - A Bug Tracking Application
<img alt="SquashIt Logo" src="images/logo.png" width=200px height=120px>  

**SquashIt** is a **bug tracking application** built with **C#**, **Entity Framework Core**, and **ASP.Net**.  
This phase molds the Phase 1 console application into a fully structured ASP.NET Core Web API, designed to provide a clean, scalable, and frontend-ready backend service. It demonstrates modern backend engineering practices including layered architecture, RESTful API design, Entity Framework Core integration, and production-ready patterns suitable for consumption by a React frontend in Phase 3.

---

## 💡 Purpose

This phase was created to highlight:
- Proficiency with **ASP.NET Core Web API** development
- Understanding of **RESTful architecture**, routing, controllers, and action results
- Implementation of **clean, layered architecture** (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API)
- Use of **DTOs**, **services**, and **dependency injection**s to enforce separation of concerns
- Integration of **Entity Framework Core** within a production-ready backend
- Delivery of a backend service suitable for consumption by a **React frontend** in Phase 3


It serves as the backend foundation of the full-stack version of the project, transforming the Phase 1 design into a scalable, maintainable, and API-driven system.

## 🗂️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technologies |
|:------|:--------------|
| **Backend Framework** | ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 8)|
| **Language** | C# |
| **Database** | SQLite |
| **ORM** | Entity Framework Core (Code first) |
| **Architecture** | Clean Architecture (Domain / Application / Infrastructure / API) |
| **API tooling** | Swagger / OpenAPI |
| **Tools** | Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub |

## 🧠 What It Demonstrates

- Building a **RESTful Web API** using ASP.NET Core and modern .NET 8 conventions  
- Structuring a backend using **clean architectural layers** (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API)  
- Implementing **service-based business logic** through dependency injection  
- Exposing data safely using **DTOs**, model binding, and validation  
- Integrating **Entity Framework Core** with migrations and persistent SQLite storage  
- Producing fully documented and testable endpoints using **Swagger/OpenAPI**
