<img alt="SquashIt Logo" src="images/logo.png" width=200px height=120px>  

**SquashIt** is a **bug tracking console application** built with **C#** and **Entity Framework Core**.  
It was developed as part of a personal portfolio project to demonstrate database design, code-first development, and clean architecture practices within the .NET ecosystem.

---

## 💡 Purpose

This phase was created to highlight:
- Proficiency with **Entity Framework Core** and **LINQ**
- Understanding of **data modeling**, **relationships**, and **migrations**
- Implementation of **persistent storage** using **SQLite**
- Experience building organized, maintainable **C# applications**

It serves as a console-based foundation for what could later evolve into a full-stack application.

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- Create, update, and delete bug reports  
- Categorize and prioritize issues  
- Filter and query data through LINQ  
- SQLite database integration through EF Core  
- Clear, layered structure separating models, data, and logic  

---

## 🗂️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technologies |
|:------|:--------------|
| **Language** | C# / .NET 8 / SQL|
| **Database** | SQLite |
| **ORM** | Entity Framework Core (Code first) |
| **Tools** | Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub |

---

## 🧠 What It Demonstrates

- Applying **object-relational mapping** concepts in a practical project  
- Managing schema evolution with **EF Core migrations**  
- Writing clear, reusable **repository-style logic** for CRUD operations  
- Organizing a console-based project that mirrors real-world architecture patterns
